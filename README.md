⚙️ Installation & Setup

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Disease-Prediction.git
cd Disease-Prediction


Install dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib


Open Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook


Run Disease_Prediction.ipynb

📊 Usage

Run the notebook cell by cell.

The dataset will be loaded and the model will be trained.

Enter symptoms or user input values.

The model will output the predicted disease.

Example Input:

Symptoms: Fever, Cough, Fatigue


Example Output:

Predicted Disease: Influenza

🔮 Future Improvements
